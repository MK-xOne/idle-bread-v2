/**
 * resources.ts
 * --------------
 * Defines the static metadata for all resource types in the game.
 * 
 * Each resource entry includes:
 * - Identity and appearance (id, name, icon, description)
 * - Gameplay properties (edibility, hunger values, inventory caps)
 * - Harvest parameters (amount range, success rate)
 * - Supported actions and their bound logic functions
 * 
 * This file acts as a centralized registry for resource definitions,
 * enabling the UI and systems to reference consistent, structured
 * data across the game loop.
